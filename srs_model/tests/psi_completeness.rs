//! Completeness of `ik::solve`'s `FromSeed` redundancy resolution.
//!
//! `solve` resolves the arm angle (ψ) analytically: it computes the exact set of
//! feasible ψ intervals and returns the one nearest the seed. So whenever a
//! reachable target admits *any* in-limit configuration, `solve` must return one,
//! regardless of the seed.
//!
//! Each target here is the FK of a real in-limit sample, so it is reachable and
//! at least one ψ (the sample's own arm angle) is feasible. Seeding `solve` with
//! an *unrelated* configuration forces it off that angle, exercising the interval
//! search rather than the trivial "seed angle already works" path. Deterministic
//! (fixed RNG seed); a regression in the analytic search fails this immediately.
