//! OpenArm v10 deployment geometry shared by the integration test and the
//! visualizer (included via `#[path]` from both, so it is one source of truth).
//!
//! The torso (`openarm_body_link0`) is concave: a wide base plate, a flared
//! shoulder skirt, a diagonal gusset, a thin central column, and a tapering
//! head. Its auto-fit single hull bridges those into one bulging solid that
//! clips the grippers at rest. These clip regions decompose it instead; each
//! region's slice of the mesh gets the same rounded simplified-hull fit a link
//! gets, so every piece tracks the mesh surface. Supply them via
//! [`Builder::regions`] for the torso body.
//!
//! Feature extents measured from the collision mesh (`body_link0_symp.stl`,
//! mm, root frame):
//!
//! ```text
//!  plate   z 0..8, full footprint x [-155, 95], y [-95, 95]
//!  flare   skirt necking y +/-85 (z 12.6) -> +/-30 (z 70), x +/-25
//!  gusset  y +/-30 web from the plate (x -153..-118 at z 8) up a straight
//!          hypotenuse to the column rear (x -30 at z 161..221)
//!  column  x/y +/-30 square (2 mm corner fillets), z 19..604
//!  head    z 603..773; flares to y +/-79 by z 625, x peaks [-85, 65] at
//!          z 695, tapers to about (+/-30, +/-44) at z 770
//! ```
//!
//! Region placement rules (why each bound sits where it does):
//! - Adjacent regions overlap by >= 3 mm. The build check certifies each
//!   ~1 mm face patch inside a single piece, and the mesh has giant wall
//!   triangles crossing every cut, so exact shared cut planes would fail it.
//! - Bounds sit ~1 mm off large flat mesh faces: a region bound resting on
//!   the plate top plane (z = 8 mm) would capture fragments of that whole
//!   face and balloon its piece (the gusset region starts at z = 9 mm).
//! - The gusset region is what makes the decomposition tight: clipped on its
//!   own, its slice hulls to the wedge along the hypotenuse instead of the
//!   old bounding box, whose empty triangle above the diagonal read false
//!   proximity through the workspace behind the column.
//! - The head is banded in z so each piece follows the taper instead of one
//!   box carrying the widest extents over the full 170 mm.
