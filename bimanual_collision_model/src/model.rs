//! The runtime model: both arms' convex-hull pieces placed by forward
//! kinematics and the minimum signed distance over the checked pairs.
//!
//! Built once from the URDF plus its collision meshes, queried every tick with
//! the two joint configurations. A query is FK plus GJK over the checked
//! piece-pairs; where pieces overlap, EPA recovers the penetration depth, so
//! the distance is signed and continuous through contact.
//!
//! The checked pairs are derived at construction from the URDF: every body
//! pair except those that cannot inform (two fixed bodies never change
//! distance) or that touch by construction (URDF-adjacent, joint-yoked bodies).
//! The hulls are tight: the reported distance is the true surface clearance, with
//! no safety margin baked into the geometry. Keeping the arms apart is the
//! caller's job (a deployment band over the reported distance), not a margin the
//! model papers over.
