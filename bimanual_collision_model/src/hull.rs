//! Exact convex hull of a point cloud, computed once at construction. The hull
//! is the geometric reference everything else is measured against: it is the
//! tightest convex body containing the mesh, so a proxy's deviation is its
//! distance from this hull.
//!
//! Quickhull (Barber, Dobkin & Huhdanpaa 1996): seed a tetrahedron, partition
//! the cloud into per-facet *outside sets*, then repeatedly take the point
//! farthest in front of a facet, delete every facet that point can see, and
//! stitch it to the horizon those facets leave behind. The outside sets are what
//! make it scale: a point is only ever tested against the handful of facets that
//! could claim it, never against the whole hull, so a 68k-point collision mesh
//! builds in milliseconds rather than stalling.
//!
//! Face orientation is kept robust by pointing every normal away from a fixed
//! interior point instead of tracking winding, so the horizon is found purely by
//! counting shared edges.
//!
//! Scope of the result: outside sets hold each point against one facet (the one
//! it stands furthest in front of, so the cap that replaces that facet still
//! faces it), and a deleted facet's points are re-offered to the cap. That is the
//! standard bookkeeping and it terminates with every point inside on real meshes,
//! which [`tests::a_real_collision_mesh_hulls_exactly`] pins. It is not a proof:
//! nothing here re-tests a point against a facet that survived. So this hull is
//! used as the *measurement reference* for how tightly a proxy follows a mesh, and
//! never as the thing that guarantees the proxy contains it. That guarantee comes
//! from [`crate::simplify`], whose every plane offset is a support value taken
//! over the whole raw cloud.
