//! Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi distance between convex bodies.
//!
//! GJK computes the distance between two convex shapes from nothing but their
//! support functions (the farthest point in a direction). It works on the
//! Minkowski difference `A - B`: the shapes are disjoint exactly when the
//! origin lies outside it, and their separation is the distance from the origin
//! to it. The algorithm walks a simplex (1 to 4 points of the difference)
//! toward the origin, each step adding the support point in the direction of
//! the origin and dropping the vertices that no longer carry the closest point,
//! until no support point lies closer (Gilbert, Johnson & Keerthi 1988; van den
//! Bergen, "Collision Detection in Interactive 3D Environments"; the simplex
//! sub-distance follows Ericson, "Real-Time Collision Detection", ch. 5).
//!
//! Distance is computed on the unrounded cores, then the rounding radii are
//! subtracted (the standard margin trick), so a hull's inflation radius stays
//! separable from the query. When the cores overlap, EPA (below) recovers the
//! penetration depth and direction, so the signed distance is continuous
//! through contact: separating motion is always distinguishable from
//! approaching, even from inside an overlap.
