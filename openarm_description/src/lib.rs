//! The OpenArm robot descriptions: the single embedded source of truth for the URDFs
//! and their collision meshes, so nodes no longer each ship their own copy.
//!
//! Two hardware generations are carried, selected by [`HardwareVersion`]:
//! - [`HardwareVersion::V1`]: OpenArm v1.0 (`openarm_v10`).
//! - [`HardwareVersion::V2`]: OpenArm v2.0 (`openarm_v20`).
//!
//! - [`HardwareVersion::urdf`] returns the bundled URDF string (mechanical joint limits,
//!   as vendored).
//! - [`HardwareVersion::write_meshes_to`] (feature `meshes`) materializes the embedded
//!   collision meshes for the file-based bimanual collision builder and for any non-Rust
//!   consumer (the sim) via the `emit_meshes` binary.
//! - [`HardwareVersion::elbow_singularity_floor_rad`] / [`HardwareVersion::elbow_joint_index`]
//!   describe the elbow control margin the kinematics consumer applies (see the method docs).
//! - [`HardwareVersion::joint_limits`] resolves one side's per-joint position limits from the
//!   bundled URDF with that margin applied: the single clamp source for every node that
//!   produces joint commands.
//! - [`HardwareVersion::base_link`] names one side's chain base link in the bundled URDF:
//!   the single source for the link a kinematics chain is walked out from.
//! - [`HardwareVersion::tcp_link`] names one side's tool-center-point frame in the bundled
//!   URDF, so poses are commanded and reported at the grasp point (see the method docs for
//!   the frame convention).
//!
//! Pure data: this crate carries no solver dependency. A consumer that wants a kinematic
//! model builds it from these, e.g.
//!
//! ```text
//! srs_model::Arm::from_urdf(v.urdf(), v.base_link(side))?
//!     .with_lower_floor(v.elbow_joint_index(), v.elbow_singularity_floor_rad())
//!     .with_tool_link(v.tcp_link(side))?
//! ```
//!
//! so the description stays reusable by any consumer (a viz tool, a sim bridge) without
//! pulling a solver in. A consumer that only needs dynamics (an arm driver's gravity
//! feedforward) can skip the tool: it moves the end-effector frame, not the masses.
