//! A guarded Cartesian move: the damped resolved-rate law run against a
//! reference that walks toward the goal, leashed whenever the chain falls
//! behind.
//!
//! A discrete inverse-kinematics walk cannot cross the singular surface between
//! two solution branches. The damped law can: the damping bounds the joint rates
//! while the task error carries the chain across, deviating from the straight
//! line only where the geometry forces it and re-converging beyond. Leashing the
//! reference is what keeps that honest - the goal never runs away from an arm
//! that is grinding through a wall.
//!
//! The same law rolls out offline ([`rollout`]) before a move is accepted, which
//! is the reachability check: a goal that does not converge within the caller's
//! budget is refused rather than started. That only works because the law is
//! deterministic, so the motion that was validated is the motion that runs.
//!
//! Tolerances and the output smoother are the caller's, not this crate's. A
//! smoother is whatever bounds the command's jerk; anchoring the numbers to a
//! particular controller's defaults would make this crate carry that
//! controller's dependencies for no reason.
