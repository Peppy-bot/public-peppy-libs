//! Kinematics for a serial chain read from a URDF: forward kinematics, the
//! geometric Jacobian, and damped resolved-rate inverse kinematics.
//!
//! Nothing here assumes a topology. A [`Chain`] is any path through any URDF
//! with `N` actuated joints - a seven-axis arm, a five-axis arm, a leg, a
//! pan-tilt head - and every type is generic over `N`, fixed at compile time so
//! a control tick allocates nothing.
//!
//! Build one from a parsed URDF and a [`ChainSpec`] naming where the chain
//! starts, where it ends, and which joints are yours to move:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use chain_kinematics::{Chain, ChainSpec, JointSelection};
//! let robot = urdf_rs::read_from_string(MY_URDF)?;
//! let chain = Chain::<5>::from_urdf(&robot, &ChainSpec {
//!     base_link: None,
//!     tip_link: "gripper_frame_link",
//!     joints: JointSelection::Named(&[
//!         "shoulder_pan", "shoulder_lift", "elbow_flex", "wrist_flex", "wrist_roll",
//!     ]),
//! })?;
//! let ee = chain.at(&[0.0; 5]).ee_pose();
//! # const MY_URDF: &str = "";
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! The tip and the joint order are **named, not discovered**. Discovering a tip
//! by counting joints only works for the arm it was written for, and inferring
//! joint order from the URDF's own ordering is luck rather than a contract: the
//! order is the order of `q`, and it is usually the order the robot's wire
//! protocol uses, which no URDF knows about.
//!
//! Frames: forward kinematics reports poses in the **base frame** named by the
//! spec, and [`Chain::base_from_world`] relates that to the URDF root for a
//! caller that needs the world frame (gravity, or composing two chains of one
//! robot).
