//! Point-to-point inverse kinematics: searched, verified, and willing to refuse.
//!
//! [`Kinematics`] carries the surface frozen across this library and
//! `chain_kinematics_py`: [`inverse_kinematics`](Kinematics::inverse_kinematics)
//! for a planned move,
//! [`continue_to`](Kinematics::continue_to) for the next sample of a path,
//! [`track`](Kinematics::track) for a streamed setpoint, and
//! [`forward_kinematics`](Kinematics::forward_kinematics) to prove any of them.
//! Targets and reported poses are world-frame [`Isometry3`] values; the typed
//! rotation is what keeps a wire quaternion's component order from ever being
//! confused past the boundary.
//!
//! An accepted solution is proven: forward kinematics on the same chain puts it
//! inside the tolerance. A refusal is the search having tried every candidate
//! without one, not a proof of unreachability. A general chain has no closed
//! form to prove with; a 7-DOF SRS arm wanting proofs has `srs_model`.
//!
//! The search is bounded by work, never by the clock: it tries the same
//! candidates in the same order however fast the machine runs them, so an
//! answer is a function of its arguments alone. A wall-clock cutoff would make
//! a loaded CPU refuse targets an idle one solves, which is a plan that cannot
//! be validated on one machine and trusted on another.
//!
//! The internals are deliberately not part of that frozen surface. The damped
//! descent, the pose-ranked seed table and the two orientation passes are this
//! implementation's answer to the same problems the Python library measured its
//! own answers to (a local step has no notion of the workspace, a single
//! orientation weight is wrong in both directions, a descent at an unreachable
//! target orbits). The constants carry over with the mechanisms; the
//! qualification suite in `tests/solve_quality.rs` is what holds them to the
//! same measured bar.
