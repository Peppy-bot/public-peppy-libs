//! The URDF link/joint tree: an arena of links and joints, and the walks over
//! it that [`crate::Chain`] needs.
//!
//! A URDF is a tree of links joined by joints. This flattens it into an arena -
//! links and joints in `Vec`s, adjacency by index - and computes world
//! transforms by composing `parent * origin * joint_motion` down a path. That is
//! the whole of it: no interior mutability, no transform cache to invalidate, no
//! shared ownership. A [`Chain`] is plain data, so forward kinematics is a pure
//! function of a configuration and posing one can never race a read of another.
//!
//! Nothing here knows what a robot is, or how many joints one has. It answers
//! "where is every frame of this linkage at this configuration", for any serial
//! path through any URDF; whatever rule picks the path belongs to the caller.
//!
//! Conventions follow the URDF specification, so a chain built here agrees with
//! any other conforming reader: a joint's `origin` is `translation(xyz)` composed
//! with the extrinsic roll-pitch-yaw of `rpy`, the axis is normalised, and a
//! revolute joint contributes a pure rotation about that axis in the joint frame.
