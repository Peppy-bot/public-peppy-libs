//! Clock domains: the identity of one timeline and one instance's binding to
//! it.
//!
//! An instance reads exactly one clock for its whole lifetime. Wall time is
//! built in and needs no declaration. A simulated domain is supplied by one
//! publisher instance, and every other instance that reads it names it.
//!
//! A domain's identity is its name, the machine its publisher runs on, and an
//! incarnation minted for each lifetime of that name. Two domains are the same
//! timeline when all three agree, so compatibility is an equality check over
//! the whole identity.
