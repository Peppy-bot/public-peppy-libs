# Observation-slot delivery for the framework `observation_update` service.

# The daemon pushes ABSOLUTE observation state (never deltas) for one observer
# slot: the slot's complete ordered member set, in the order the plan listed it.
# A delivery replaces the slot wholesale, so a member the delivery omits is gone
# from the slot. `sequence` orders deliveries so a retried request can never roll
# a slot back: the node rejects strictly-smaller sequences (`staleSequence =
# true`) and treats an equal sequence as an idempotent retry.

# The node replies with the shared `SlotUpdateResponse` (see slot_update.capnp).
