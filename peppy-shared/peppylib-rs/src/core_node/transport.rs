//! Transport shims that bridge the capnp wire types in
//! [`core_node_api::encoding`] to the peppylib messenger.
//!
//! `core-node-api` holds the pure wire types (no peppylib dep) and, emitted
//! from each registry entry, the [`ServiceRequest`] / [`ActionGoal`] impl
//! pairing a request/goal codec with its response type and wire id. The
//! generic [`poll`] and [`send_goal`] here are bounded on those impls, so a
//! method added to the registry is callable through this module with no
//! per-method wrapper — and a wrong request/response pairing is
//! unrepresentable rather than merely tested for.
//!
//! The exclusions are declared in the registry itself and get no impl:
//! `SpawnedNode`-hosted services (their queryable doesn't live under the
//! daemon's service root) and `routing: bespoke` entries — of those,
//! `node_stop` keeps the hand-written [`poll_node_stop`] below.
