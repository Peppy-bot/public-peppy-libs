//! Node-invariant test machinery behind the `testing` cargo feature.
//!
//! Everything here is untyped (`Payload` in, bytes out) on purpose: this module
//! is the single implementation — per language — of the semantics that
//! generated per-node test code (peppygen's `mock` / `fixtures` surfaces) and
//! peppylib's own test binaries share. Generated code contributes only a typed
//! veneer over these cores: message-type reuse, codecs, identity constants,
//! per-link aggregation. If a helper here ever wants to name a generated type,
//! that logic belongs in the veneer instead; error types are safe because
//! generated crates re-export [`crate::PeppyError`] as their own error type.
//!
//! The module ships in the library (not `#[cfg(test)]`) so generated node test
//! code can use it, but only compiles when the `testing` feature is enabled —
//! node crates enable it via `[dev-dependencies]`, which `cargo build` never
//! resolves, so none of this can reach a production binary.
//!
//! The Python twin (`peppylib-py/peppylib/testing.py`) mirrors this module
//! member for member, plus exactly two of its own: `resolve_node_dir` and
//! `Mocks`. Both cover ground a Rust harness gets for free — the config path
//! is a compile-time `concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), …)` const, and the
//! generated `Mocks` struct tears down by `Drop` — so neither is a gap here.
//! Any *other* asymmetry between the two files is a bug.
