//! Consumer-side runtime for observer pairing slots: [`ObservationSlot`] and
//! [`ObservationSlotSet`] (observe the slot's member set) and
//! [`ObservedTopicSubscription`] (receive the observed sources' publishes on one
//! topic).
//!
//! An observer passively taps a producer's pairing topic without joining the
//! source's 1:1 pairing. It follows its sources through the shared
//! [`crate::runtime::slot_stream`] engine, which keeps one wire subscription per
//! followed pin converged with the slot's member set. Unlike a pairing slot, an
//! observer follows `(source generation, source pin)` per member, not the pin
//! alone: a source's own peer transitions never touch its subscription (the pin
//! is unchanged), while a source-incarnation change advances that member's
//! generation and so redeclares, even though a reused instance_id keeps the wire
//! triple byte-identical, which the keyexpr alone cannot tell apart. This module
//! supplies only that follow rule; the convergence, the fair merge across
//! members, and the stale filter live in the engine.
