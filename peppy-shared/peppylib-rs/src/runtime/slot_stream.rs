//! Shared consumer-side forwarding engine for pinned slots (pairing peers and
//! observer sources). Both follow producers that the daemon delivers live over
//! a slot-update service, and both want the same wire-subscription lifecycle:
//!
//! - a pin the slot no longer follows (unpaired, or a member the plan dropped)
//!   → no wire subscription at all (nothing to receive, and no wildcard shape
//!   exists for a pinned consumer);
//! - a followed pin → exactly one wire subscription, triple-pinned to the
//!   producer's `(core_node, instance_id, producer-side link_id)`;
//! - a pin changes (re-pair, or a source-incarnation change) → the old
//!   subscription is dropped BEFORE the new one is declared (at most one wire
//!   subscription per followed pin, ever), and a delivery-time stale filter
//!   drops any already-buffered message tagged with a superseded pin.
//!
//! Each slot kind differs only in what it follows. A pairing slot follows its
//! one peer pin, so its set is empty while unpaired and holds one member once
//! paired. An observer slot follows one pin per member of its set, keyed on
//! `(source generation, source pin)` so a reused instance_id under an identical
//! wire triple is still told apart. [`FollowedSlot`] captures that difference;
//! the set convergence, the one-subscription-per-pin invariant, the fair merge
//! across members, the stale filter, and teardown live here once.
