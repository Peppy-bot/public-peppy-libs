# Daemon-to-daemon messages for a federated launch.
#
# Two kinds live here, and the distinction matters:
#
#   * The RESERVATION exchange, which the coordinator drives during preflight.
#     It is the serialization point for the whole launch: the coordinator holds
#     a reservation on every participant before anything is torn down, so two
#     coordinators racing the same machines are refused before either has
#     replaced a stack. Daemons never negotiate among themselves.
#
#   * RELATIONSHIP NOTIFICATIONS, which flow at runtime between the daemon that
#     owns an instance and daemons that hold a relationship with it. These are
#     best-effort and idempotent by construction: the owning daemon stays
#     authoritative and the notification only reports what already happened, so
#     a dropped one degrades to staleness rather than to disagreement.
#
# There is deliberately no "which daemons hold a slice of my launch" message.
# The stack-list response already carries `(launchId, coordinatorCoreNode)`, so
# rediscovery is the presence fan-out `stack list` already performs, filtered by
# launch id.

# Reserves one participant for one launch.
struct ParticipantReserveRequest {
    # Identity of the launch being reserved for.
    launchId @0 :Text;
    # The coordinator driving it. The participant watches this core node's
    # presence for as long as it holds the reservation, and releases it if the
    # coordinator disappears, so a coordinator that dies mid-launch cannot wedge
    # a machine until its next daemon restart.
    coordinatorCoreNode @1 :Text;
    # JSON5-encoded `DeploymentPins`, one per deployment placed on this
    # participant: the root node's pin plus the pin of every transitive node
    # dependency and every contract and pairing document in its closure. The
    # coordinator resolves the whole launch once and every participant runs
    # exactly those bytes, so a participant's own cache freshness, repository
    # priorities and exclusions never influence a federated launch. The
    # participant validates each pin here — a refusal costs nothing, since the
    # reservation is non-destructive — and materializes it at add time,
    # reusing its own copy on a content match and fetching the pinned commit
    # otherwise. It never falls back to resolving a name.
    #
    # Opaque text: the pin model lives in peppy, whose serde decoding is the
    # validation, and this crate has no business re-deriving it.

    # here. Both name trees on the coordinator's own disk, so the plan refuses
    # them for any deployment placed off-coordinator.

# The whole payload of every exchange that names a launch and nothing else.
# Shared by `participant_slice_begin` and `participant_release`, whose requests
# are the same question asked about the same identity; the verb is the service
# name, not a field. Give an exchange its own struct the moment it needs a
# second field, rather than growing an optional one here.
#
# `participant_slice_begin` tells a reserved participant to replace its stack
# slice: tear down whatever it is running, clear it, and record that the slice
# now belongs to this launch. It is separate from the reservation on purpose —
# reserving is NON-DESTRUCTIVE and happens before the coordinator knows whether
# every participant will accept, so folding the teardown into it would replace
# a stack on machine A for a launch that machine B is about to refuse. This is
# the commit point, sent only once every participant is reserved. The launch id
# must match the reservation the participant holds, which is what stops a stale
# coordinator from wiping a machine out from under the launch that owns it.
#
# `participant_release` releases a reservation the coordinator obtained but no
# longer needs, either because a later participant refused or because the launch
# finished. Idempotent: releasing a reservation that is not held succeeds; only
# a reservation held for a DIFFERENT launch is refused, because the caller has
# no standing to release that one.

# The reply to every federation exchange whose answer is "did you do it, and if
# not, why". Shared by `participant_slice_begin`, `pair_commit` and
# `participant_release` rather than restated per service: the three differ only
# in which verb `ok` reports, and that verb is already the service name.
#
# The refusal reason is load-bearing, not decoration. A `pair_commit` refusal
# makes the sender revert its own half, so a pair is never left established on
# one machine and absent on the other; a `participant_release` refusal tells a
# coordinator its reservation was taken over rather than merely absent.
