//! Zenoh-backed implementation of [`crate::MessengerBackend`].
//!
//! ## Why callback handlers, not FIFO
//!
//! Every receive-side zenoh API call in this module (`declare_subscriber`,
//! `declare_queryable`, `session.get`) uses `.callback(...)` rather than the
//! default FIFO reception handler. Zenoh's FIFO handler holds an internal
//! `flume::bounded` channel and logs
//! `zenoh::api::handlers::fifo: error=sending on a closed channel` at ERROR
//! whenever zenoh tries to deliver a sample/query/reply after the
//! receiver-side has been dropped — a routine event in this codebase (e.g. a
//! `QueryTarget::All` `call_service` keeps the query open until its
//! `NO_TIMEOUT_SENTINEL`, and sibling producers' late replies hit a
//! `ReplyStream` the consumer dropped after the first valid response).
//!
//! Callback handlers have no intermediate channel: each callback invocation
//! either forwards into our own `flume::bounded` channel (subscriber /
//! queryable, where blocking `send` preserves backpressure) or our own tokio
//! mpsc (`call_service`, where `try_send` silently drops on a closed/full
//! receiver because the caller only needs the first valid reply).
//!
//! The `tests/fifo_noise.rs` integration test pins this invariant: it
//! asserts zero `zenoh::api::handlers::fifo` ERROR events during a wildcard
//! service call with a late-replying sibling producer.
