// The MockAdapter in-process backend is compiled into every build alongside the
// zenoh transport, but it is not a standalone zenoh-less build target: the mock
// uses tokio's `time` and multi-thread runtime, which this crate only obtains
// transitively through the `zenoh` dependency. A `--no-default-features` build
// (no zenoh) therefore does not compile. Every supported configuration enables
// `zenoh` (the default). See the `tokio` note in Cargo.toml.

// `deny` rather than `forbid` so exactly one scoped opt-out can exist: the
// `pre_exec` + `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)` block in `zenohd::facade` that lets the
// kernel reap an ephemeral router when its SIGKILLed owner can run no Drop.
// `pre_exec` is unsafe by signature, so there is no safe equivalent; any other
// unsafe stays denied crate-wide (mirrors peppylib-rs's policy).
