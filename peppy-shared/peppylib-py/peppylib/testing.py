"""Node-invariant test machinery — the Python twin of Rust's ``peppylib::testing``.

Everything here is untyped (``bytes`` in, ``bytes`` out) on purpose: this module
is the single Python implementation of the semantics that generated per-node
test code (peppygen's ``mock`` / ``fixtures`` surfaces) and peppylib's own test
suites share. Generated code contributes only a typed veneer over these cores:
message-type reuse, codecs, identity constants, per-link aggregation. If a
helper here ever wants to name a generated type, that logic belongs in the
veneer instead.

Deliberately not imported by ``peppylib/__init__.py``: the wheel ships it
inert, and only test code ever imports ``peppylib.testing``.

Semantics mirror ``peppylib-rs/src/testing.rs`` — mirror, not re-design; a
behavior difference between the two is a bug here, and both sides carry
equivalent test suites in public-peppy-libs to surface one early.

Two members are deliberately Python-only, because the Rust harness gets the
same guarantee from a language affordance rather than from a helper:
:func:`resolve_node_dir` (Rust bakes the path at compile time via
``concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), …)``, so it never searches) and
:class:`Mocks` (Rust drops its mock struct, so it needs no explicit
``stop_all``). Neither has a Rust counterpart to drift from. Anything else
appearing on one side only is a bug, not a precedent.
