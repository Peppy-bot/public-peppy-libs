# The collapsed park pose the arm ships in and rests in, measured on
# hardware and pulled inside the model: the physical fold reaches -1.80 rad
# on the shoulder, past the URDF's -1.745 floor (the model under-states the
# real travel), so the target rests just inside it. Folded onto the base,
# stable, minimal holding torque, safe to release.
# Wrist at 1.12, not the measured 1.24: the resting wrist lies ON the base,
# and holding the measured value as a servo target presses into the contact
# (sustained load, warm alerts). 1.12 hovers just clear, verified nominal
# on hardware.
