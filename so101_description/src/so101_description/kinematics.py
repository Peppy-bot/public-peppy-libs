"""FK/IK over placo's kinematics solver, radians at this boundary.

placo speaks 4x4 matrices; everything above this module speaks joint_link
radians and wire poses. IK is verified by FK before it is trusted: placo
returns its best effort even far from the target, and an unreached pose must
fail the caller instead of moving the arm somewhere else.

What that verification costs, measured on poses reachable by construction (a
random in-limits joint vector, its FK taken as the target): 14% of targets are
refused when seeded from the ready posture and 39% when seeded from an
arbitrary one, concentrated near the base (25% within 0.23 m, 7% beyond
0.45 m). The cause is structural rather than a tuning miss. A solve is a
single linearised QP step, so iterating it is a local descent from the seed
and reaches only what the seed's branch reaches; a refusal means this branch
did not arrive, not that the pose is unreachable. Callers that need the wider
workspace re-seed and ask again.

ApproachSolver is the other solver here, for the workspace answer: where the
grasp point can go, with the gripper's approach axis along a direction. It
has its own model and QP, and its own seeds, which it takes from a table of
postures across the whole joint space. Its ReachSphere holds every point the
grasp point can go to, by construction from the joint chain of the URDF.

    1. A URDF joint puts the frame of its child link at the joint's origin

    The grasp point is the origin of END_EFFECTOR_FRAME and the approach axis
    is that frame's +Z, out of the gripper. Five joints leave the roll about
    the approach axis free, so a direction sets the approach axis alone; the
    roll the gripper ends at is not chosen.

    The solver has its own placo model and QP, apart from Kinematics, and
    its own seeds: a caller gives a position and a direction only. It is not
    thread safe: give each thread or process its own.

    How it searches. A solve is a descent of the QP from a seed, with a
    position task and an axis-align task on the grasp frame. Each step turns
    an arm joint by at most APPROACH_STEP_RAD and the wrist roll by at most
    APPROACH_ROLL_STEP_RAD. The seeds come from a table of postures across
    the joint space, taken once at construction at pan zero: the solver turns
    the table about the pan axis so that the arm's vertical plane holds the
    target (facing it, or reaching over the shoulder from behind) and, for a
    direction with a horizontal part, the direction. It then starts from the
    postures nearest the asked pose, and from one at the pan that faces the
    target, rank by rank: in each rank of
    APPROACH_SEED_RANKS_METRES_PER_RADIAN, a radian of the approach axis
    weighs as much as that many metres of the position (see _seeds). The
    seeds do not depend on the bars. Position and approach are soft
    objectives of the QP, the heavier at a weight of APPROACH_QP_MAX_WEIGHT,
    and an approach at the edge of the reach meets both bars only in a
    narrow range of their trade: the solver searches that trade from one
    seed (see _Trade).

    By construction, an answer is verified: the joints are moved into the
    joint limits, and forward kinematics must put them within both bars. A
    position that the reach sphere (`reach_sphere`, see ReachSphere) rules
    out at the position bar gets None at once: no pose meets that bar there.

    Measured on this model at the bars of a workspace answer, 0.01 m and
    0.05 rad, on samples not used to tune the search. Of 1800 random
    in-limit joint vectors (RNG seeds 9301, 9302 and 9303), it reaches the

    0.022 to 0.042 rad from that axis. Of 6000 targets near the corner of
    both bars (RNG seeds 888001, 888002 and 888003), it leaves 2 unreached:
    each target is 9 mm from the grasp point of a random in-limit joint
    vector, in a random direction, and its direction is 0.045 rad from the

    axis, it leaves 14 unreached at 0.001 m and 0.005 rad, 11 at 0.002 m
    and 0.01 rad, 3 at 0.002 m and 0.02 rad, 1 at 0.01 m and 0.001 rad, and
    none at the other pairs. In a direction 0.022 to 0.042 rad from their
    approach axis, at the pairs with an angle bar of 0.05 rad, it leaves 1
    unreached at 0.001 m and 1 at 0.002 m. At 0.01 m and pi rad, where
    every direction meets the angle bar, it reaches each grasp point in a
    random direction. No pose reached at one pair is missed at a looser
    pair. This is a measurement, not a rule of the search: the seeds do not
    depend on the bars, but the trades of a descent start at the ratio of
    the bars.

    On the samples that the search is tuned on, at the bars of a workspace
    answer, it leaves none unreached: the grasp points of in-limit joint
    vectors whose approach axis is within 0.03 rad of straight down or
    straight forward, on two fixed joint grids (33465 targets), and of 3000
    random in-limit joint vectors (RNG seed 12345) along their own approach
    axis. On the workspace grid of 51 rows by 13 lanes above surfaces at
    seven heights from -0.2 to 0.2 m, also a sample that the search is
    tuned on, it reaches each grid point that a dense sampling of the joint
    space reaches, and 15 more at the corner of both bars.

    A full workspace grid (down, then forward, at each grid point the reach
    sphere does not rule out, and the least distance of each grid point no
    direction reaches) takes 0.9 to 1.8 s of CPU time on a loaded AMD EPYC
    Genoa, at surface heights from -0.3 to 0.4 m.

        of the roll on the wrong side. A descent stops as soon as it comes
        within APPROACH_DISTANCE_RESOLUTION_M.

        The answer is the distance at one step of a descent. The QP keeps
        the joints of a step inside the joint limits only to a measured
        error (see APPROACH_QP_MAX_WEIGHT). So the answer is a distance that
        the grasp point reaches at joints inside the limits to that error,
