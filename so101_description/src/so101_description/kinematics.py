"""FK/IK over lerobot's placo-based RobotKinematics, radians at this boundary.

lerobot's solver speaks degrees and 4x4 matrices; everything above this module
speaks joint_link radians and wire poses. IK is verified by FK before it is
trusted: placo returns its best effort even far from the target, and an
unreached pose must fail the caller instead of moving the arm somewhere else.

What that verification costs, measured on poses reachable by construction (a
random in-limits joint vector, its FK taken as the target): 14% of targets are
refused when seeded from the ready posture and 39% when seeded from an
arbitrary one, concentrated near the base (25% within 0.23 m, 7% beyond
0.45 m). The cause is structural rather than a tuning miss. lerobot's
inverse_kinematics is a single linearised step, so iterating it is a local
descent from the seed and reaches only what the seed's branch reaches; a
refusal means this branch did not arrive, not that the pose is unreachable.
Callers that need the wider workspace re-seed and ask again.
